Description: In this file is the code to find the peak of the integer valued function as 
             mentioned in the question . We have adopted the Divide and Conquer Paradigm to 
             solve this question in Order Logarithmic time with the help of a blackbox1.o 
	     precompiled for our usage provided by the question setter .

/*
Name - findpeak()
Input - Void 
Output - Returns the position of the maxima
Description -
This is the function which enables us to calculate the peak of the function which is implemented via
the black box . In the first while loop we keep on incrementing our variable i such that we reach the
part of the function where it is decreasing. The choice of the base and the exponent were chosen as a 
result of hit and try to get an optimal combination which gives us the answer in least required calls
